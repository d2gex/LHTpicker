# LHTpicker

This is a thin wrapper over [FishLife](https://github.com/James-Thorson-NOAA/FishLife) library that helps to abstract 
the underlying data structure, easing the fetch and update of local LHTs. The following processes have been integrated:

1. Fetch predicted LHTs **'as is'** from FishLife.
2. Provide redicting LHTs and fetch the updated predicted values from FishLife.
3. Both processes, 1 and 2 can be accomplished in a streamline fashion for multiple species via a csv file.
